# amp
A tool that reads data from standard input (stdin) and writes to various output streams.

## Finally!

I herewith proudly announce version 1.0 of `amp`!

Major and minor bugs have been fixed, new features have been implemented and the code has been totally revised.

If you're still using the old version of `amp` (prior to 1.0), please download and compile the latest version.

## How to compile

`gcc -Wall -o amp amp.h main.c amp.c args.c llist.c log.c utils.c -lm`
