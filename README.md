# amp
A small tool that reads data from standard input (stdin) and writes it to various output streams.

*I'm still working hard to implement new features and improve the code. I hope to get a stable version done the next few days*

## How to compile

`gcc -o amp amp.h amp.c amp_arg.c amp_log.c amp_lst.c`
